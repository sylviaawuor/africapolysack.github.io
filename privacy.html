              <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
              <h6>As of the year 2020</h6>

              <div class="privacy-content">
                <p>The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we’re starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services, and communicate with others from around the world. It’s important to AFRICA POLYSACK to help our customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer.</p>

                <p>We believe your business is no one else’s. Your privacy is important to you…and to us. So we’ll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, AFRICA POLYSACK follows different principles in accordance with world-wide practices for customer privacy and data protection. We won’t sell or give away your name, mail address, phone number, email address, credit card number or any other information to anyone. We’ll use state-of-the-art security measures to protect your information from unauthorized users.</p>

                <h5>NOTICE</h5>
                <p>We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to contact you. Generally this information is requested when you create a Registration ID on the site or when you download free software, enter a contest, order e-mail newsletters or join a limited-access premium site. We use your Personal Information for four primary purposes:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.</li>
                  <li>To help you quickly find software, services or information.</li>
                  <li>To help us create content most relevant to you.</li>
                  <li>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from AFRICA POLYSACK.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>CONSENT</h5>

                <p>If you choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still use most of [WEB SITE]. But you will not be able to access areas that require registration. If you decide to register, you will be able to select the kinds of information you want to receive from us by subscribing to various services, like our electronic newsletters. If you do not want us to communicate with you about other offers regarding AFRICA POLYSACK products, programs, events, or services by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing messages from AFRICA POLYSACK. AFRICA POLYSACK occasionally allows other companies to offer our registered customers information about their products and services, using postal mail only. If you do not want to receive these offers, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third parties.</p>

                <h5>ACCESS</h5>

                <p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the Visitor Center. There, you can:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>View and edit personal information you have already given us.</li>
                  <li>Tell us whether you want us to send you marketing information, or whether you want third parties to send you their offers by postal mail.</li>
                  <li>Sign up for electronic newsletters about our services and products.</li>
                  <li>Register. Once you register, you won’t need to do it again. Wherever you go on [WEB SITE], your information stays with you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>SECURITY</h5>

                <p>AFRICA POLYSACK has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We guarantee your e-commerce transactions to be 100% safe and secure. When you place orders or access your personal account information, you’re utilizing a secure server software SSL, which encrypts your personal information before it’s sent over the Internet. SSL is one of the safest encryption technologies available. In addition, your transactions are guaranteed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. This Act states that your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 in fraudulent credit card charges. If your bank does hold you liable for $50.00 or less, we’ll cover your liability provided the unauthorized, fraudulent use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own and from purchases made from us over our secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>

                <p>AFRICA POLYSACK strictly protects the security of your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in [COUNTRY] or any other country where AFRICA POLYSACK, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located. You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not share these with others.</p>

                <h5>NOTICE TO PARENTS</h5>

                <p>Parents or guardians: we want to help you guard your children’s privacy. We encourage you to talk to your children about safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet. The AFRICA POLYSACK site does not publish content that is targeted to children. However, if you are concerned about your children providing AFRICA POLYSACK any personal information without your consent, AFRICA POLYSACK offers a Kids account. It allows parents to give parental consent for the collection, use and sharing of children’s (ages 12 and under) personal information online.</p>
